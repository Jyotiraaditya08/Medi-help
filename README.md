Its about booking beds and oxygen cylinders (presently) from a hospital required by the customer.
Login can be done by registering the details or through google sign in... more options can be added in the future.
In the home page, directly you can view the hospital names and their images. Below the name, we can see the beds and oxygen cylinders price.
If we want to book any, we just need to check the box beside that and do the payment.
On the top right corner of the home page, we can see a menu where we'll be having profile contacting details, settings and logout option.
